System Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The standard Jupyter notebook has three components, (1) the client that makes up the notebook cells, (2) a web server that lists notebook files, directories and serves notebook assets like HTML and CSS (3) a kernel that executes commands in the chosen language (in our case Python).

   Components of the Jupyter Notebook

When you execute python in a Jupyter Notebook cell the python code was transmitted (as a string) over a web socket to the webserver, then proxied through ZeroMQ to the IPykernel where it was evaluated as a Python expression. The results of that execution are then sent back over the ZeroMQ/Websocket connection and displayed in your browser. This is the standard way in which Jupyter notebook takes code from a web browser, and executes it in an interactive shell (kernel) and returns the output.
