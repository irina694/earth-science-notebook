This is the standard way in which Jupyter notebook takes code from a web browser,  and executes it in an interactive shell (kernel). M is an object in the kernel,  and it has a function *set_center*.  That function executed and returned a [promise](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/promise),  which is why you see something in the cell output like ```<promise.promise.Promise at 0x7f567dd8f290>```\n",
